This project is a modern Go language extension of the popular [go-kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) library. It includes gRPC streams and WebSocket transport implementations, which were previously absent in `go-kit`. These additions are intended to make the library more versatile for contemporary Go developers. A few packages with small yet practical functions and types are also included in this project for convenience and ease of use.

## Motivation

While `go-kit` is a powerful toolkit for developing microservices in Go, it lacked support for some crucial features - gRPC streams and WebSocket transport. These two elements are increasingly fundamental to modern software architectures, enabling efficient, real-time data exchange.

Recognizing the need for these features, there emerged an opportunity to enhance go-kit's capabilities by incorporating them. However, integrating gRPC streams and WebSocket transport went beyond simply adding new features - it reflected an adaptation to the evolving landscape of Go. Leveraging modern Go features like generics, the goal was to provide a more advanced, seamless, and comprehensive toolkit for developers.

## Features

- **Streaming friendly endpoint abstractions** that supports both gRPC and WebSocket transport.
- **gRPC Streams**: Built to support robust client-side, server-side and bi-side streaming.
- **WebSocket**: A robust, performant WebSocket transport layer designed for real-time communication whose usage is close to gRPC bi-side streaming.
- Utilitarian Functions & Types: Additional functional utilities and types (such as [X-Request-ID](/xrequestid/handler.go) for requests tagging, [Chain](/util/middleware.go) for middlewares e.g.) to expedite your Go application development.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/einouqo/ext-kit
```

## Usage

#### gRPC Bi-Directional Streaming

You can refer to the [tests](test/transport/grpc) for more examples.

**Server:**
```go
func NewServerBinding(svc Service, opts ...kitgrpc.ServerOption) *ServerBinding {
	return &ServerBinding{
		/* ... */
		biStream: kitgrpc.NewServerBiStream[*pb.EchoRequest](
			svc.Bi,
			decodeRequest,
			encodeResponse,
			opts...,
		),
	}
}
```

**Client:**
```go
func NewClientBinding(cc *grpc.ClientConn) *ClientBinding {
	return &ClientBinding{
		/* ... */
		BiStream: kitgrpc.NewClientBiStream[*pb.EchoResponse](
			cc,
			pb.Echo_BiStream_FullMethodName,
			encodeRequest,
			decodeResponse,
		).Endpoint(),
	}
}
```

Make a call:
```go
sendCh := make(chan service.EchoRequest) // send your requests to the channel in the way you want
receive, err := client.BiStream(ctx, sendCh)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
for {
    msg, err := receive()
    switch {
    case errors.Is(err, endpoint.StreamDone):
        return
    case err != nil:
        // handle error
    }
    // handle message
}
```

#### WebSocket
The usage is pretty close to gRPC Bi-Directional Streaming (the example above), but with WebSocket transport inside.

You can also refer to the [tests](test/transport/ws) or [autobahn](test/transport/autobahn) implementation for more examples.

**Note:** while closing `sendCh` channel leads to closing send direction of the stream in case of gRPC, while closing `sendCh` channel leads to sending a close control message and following connection close in case of WebSocket.
